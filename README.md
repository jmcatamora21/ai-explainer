# 🧠 AI Explainer – Browser Extension

**AI Explainer** is a browser extension that lets users highlight any text on a webpage, right-click, and instantly get a clear, AI-generated explanation — turning the entire web into an interactive learning environment.

Unlike simple text explainers, **AI Explainer** understands the *context of the website* and adapts its explanations accordingly. Whether you’re reading developer documentation, research papers, or news articles, it tailors the response to match the subject matter — delivering more accurate, relevant, and helpful answers.
